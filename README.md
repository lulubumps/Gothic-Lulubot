# Gothic Lulubot
<img src="/src/img/readme-img.jpg" alt="Presentation"/>

Hello, this is an open source project created for Discord, I call it "Gothic Lulubot". Unlike other bots, this one is capable of playing music from YT, Sfy, Dzr, among other platforms. It is easy to integrate and its code is free so you can use it whenever and wherever you want to integrate it (if you like, you can leave me in the credits in your creation, or leave a small donation in Ko-Fi).

This project is still in progress, but we hope that the bot can grow even more, with admin panels and external details (but that will be much later, since I have to put together a small team of programmers for this).

Thank you all for being a part of this project, and we look forward to continuing to improve this over time.
